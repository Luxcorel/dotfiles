# Logging Best Practices Skill

A skill for AI coding assistants to apply logging best practices when writing or reviewing code.

## Overview

This skill teaches the **wide events** pattern (also known as canonical log lines) - emit a single, context-rich event per request per service instead of scattered log statements.

## Key Concepts

- **Wide Events**: One comprehensive event per request, emitted at completion
- **High Cardinality**: Support fields with millions of unique values (user_id, request_id)
- **High Dimensionality**: Include many fields (20+) per event
- **Business Context**: Always include user subscription, cart value, feature flags
- **Environment Context**: Always include commit hash, version, region, instance ID
- **Single Logger**: One logger instance configured at startup, used everywhere
- **Middleware Pattern**: Handle logging infrastructure in middleware, business context in handlers

## Rules

1. **Wide Events** (CRITICAL) - One event per request, emit in finally block, request ID correlation
2. **Context** (CRITICAL) - High cardinality, dimensionality, business context, environment characteristics
3. **Structure** (HIGH) - Single logger, middleware pattern, JSON format, consistent schema
4. **Pitfalls** (MEDIUM) - Scattered logs, unknown unknowns, missing request correlation
